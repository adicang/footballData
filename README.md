## Device adaptation
The app is adapted for large screen sizes as well as for mobile screen sizes.

## Things to improve in the app
- Routing issues need to be resolved when uploading the project to github pages (when refreshing the page and entering a url that is not the baseurl - 404)
- There is a lack of information returning from API requests - maybe use another API source.
- In mobile, the table is scrollable but it is still difficult to see the table and responsiveness can be improved.
